There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Picky Notes

## Sub-Heading ##
  > The product would primarily benefit college students and people who regularly attend seminars.

## Summary ##
  > The product is a collaborative note taking application that reinforces active learning through note comparison. Users would need to choose the best notes from other collaborators, letting them find where their understanding may be lacking or simply different from others around them. A stronger connection is formed between concepts by linking written notes with the audio associated in the lecture.

## Problem ##
  > It is almost impossible to take lecture notes that cover all points of the lecture without collaboration between students.

## Solution ##
  > The application allows users to take notes separately during the lecture, and then pick from their favorite set of notes from other members of the group at the end of the lecture to create a custom page of notes.

## Quote from You ##
  > "I went from almost failing my course to passing in flying colors thanks to this app."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Just go to "www.pickynotes.com", create an account, find some friends, create a room, and start picking each others notes!

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Before Picky Notes, I was always embarrassed to  pick others' notes. Now, I can pick my notes however I choose!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Head to www.pickynotes.com and start picking notes today!
